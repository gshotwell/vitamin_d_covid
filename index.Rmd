# Direct research on vitamin D and Covid

### Supplementation studies

**Randomized**

*Supports link to vitamin D*

-   A [parallel pilot randomized open label](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960076020302764?via%3Dihub#tbl0005) trial of 76 patients in Spain found that the administration of calcifediol reduced ICU admission and mortality. Of the 50 patients treated with 1000 ug of calcifediol. 13/26 patients in the control group required ICU care compared with 1 in the intervention group. A [subsequent statistical analysis](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.08.20222638v1) showed that decreased ICU admissions were not due to uneven distribution of comorbidities or other prognostic indicators, to imperfect blinding, or to chance, but were instead associated with the calcifediol intervention. (Castillo et all, August 2020)
-   A randomized, [placebo controlled trial](https://pmj.bmj.com/content/early/2020/11/12/postgradmedj-2020-139065.full) found that therapeutic, high-dose cholecalciferol supplementation led to SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative status in additional 41.7% of mildly symptomatic Covid patients (p\<0.001) and was useful for viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance.
-   A randomized [open-label trial](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-152494/v1) of 87 vitamin D deficient Covid patients found that supplementation of 60,000 IU/day for 8-10 days reduced inflammatory biomarkers including CRP and IL-6. (Lakkireddy et al, 2021)
-   A randomized [open-label trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34202578/) of 69 hospitalized patients found that those who received 5,000 IU of vitamin D daily recovered from cough and ageusia more quickly than those who received 1,000 IU. This study seems to suffer from the multiple testing problem and its conclusions should be treated with a grain of salt. ([Sabico](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Sabico+S&cauthor_id=34202578) et al, August 2021)
-   A randomized controlled [open-label trial](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8756328221003410?via%3Dihub) of 50 hospitalized Covid patients found that calcitriol supplementation improved the respiratory status (SpO2/FIO2) of treated patients. (Elamir et al, September 2021)
-   A randomized, blinded, [placebo controlled trial](https://www.endocrinepractice.org/article/S1530-891X(21)01259-3/fulltext) (n = 106) found that patients treated with low dose calcifediol (25 ug) had a better neutrophile to lymphocyte ration than controls. The trial did not detect a significant difference in mortality, ICU admission, or length of hospital stay. ([Maghbooli](https://www.endocrinepractice.org/article/S1530-891X(21)01259-3/fulltext# "Correspondence information about the author Zhila Maghbooli, Ph.D") et al, October 2021)
-   A randomized, blinded, [placebo controlled trial](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0188440922000455?via%3Dihub) (n = 198) of health care workers in Mexico city found that vitamin D supplementation reduced Covid-19 infection. The relative risk was 0.23 with a CI between 0.09--0.55. (Keever et al, April 2022)

*Does not support vitamin D link*

-   A randomized, placebo controlled [trial](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.16.20232397v1) of 240 patients found that a one-time supplementation of 200,000 IU of vitamin D, on average 10 days after symptom onset did not reduce the length of hospital stay in severe Covid-19 patients. The treatment was safe and well tolerated.
-   A [study of 175](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34302132/) ICU patients found that high-dose paraternal vitamin D did not reduce the need for mechanical ventilation or death. Note that vitamin D was administered after ICU admission. (Güven and Gültekin, July 2021)
-   A [study of 170](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.31.22270036v1?rss=1) outpatients found that calcifediol supplementation did not improve symptom resolution. Note that vitamin D levels in the placebo arm were high (37 ng/ml at baseline). (Bishop et al, February 2022)
-   A [RCT of 6200 people](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.22.22271707v1) found that vitamin D supplementation of 3,200 IU/day did not reduce Covid-19 infection or severity as compared with 800 IU/day or no-offer groups. There was a very high vaccination rate in all arms of the trial which may have overwhelmed any potential treatment effect. (Jolliffe et al, March 2022)

**Non-Randomized**

*Supports vitamin D*

1)  A [ward randomized tria](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34097036/)l of 984 patients found that those supplemented with calcifediol had a lower ICU admissions rate and mortality rate than the control wards. (Nogues et all, June 2021)
2)  A [large propensity score matched study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.27.21255937v1) of 16,000 patients found that calcifediol and cholecalciferol supplementation were associated with large reductions in Covid--19 mortality. (Loucera et al, April 2021)
3)  A [cohort study](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/6/1760) of 574 patients in Spain found that calcifediol supplementation was associated with a significant decrease in in-hospital mortality with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.16. ([Alcala-Diaz](https://sciprofiles.com/profile/687346) et al, May 2021)
4)  A [small cohort trial](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900720303002) found that just 16% of patients who received vitamin D, magnesium, and vitamin B12 required oxygen compared with 61.5% of the previous cohort who did not receive DBM supplementation. (Chuen Wen Tan, October 2020)
5)  A [retrospective study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3690902) found that hospitalized patients who were treated with vitamin D were less likely to die than those who did not receive vitamin D. (Ling et all, October 2020)
6)  [A retrospective study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096007602030296X#fig0010) found that French nursing home residents who had recently received a bolus dose of vitamin D were more likely to survive a Covid-19 infection than residents who had not recently received a supplement. 92% of the 57 people who received vitamin D survived, while 66% of the 9 people in the cooperator group survived. (Anweller et. al, October 2020)
7)  [A retrospective study](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/11/3377) found that regular bolus vitamin D supplementation was associated with less severe COVID-19 and better survival in frail elderly. (Anweller et. al, November 2020)
8)  A [follow-up study](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/11/3377) found that geriatric Covid patients who received regular vitamin D supplementation prior to infection were less likely to experience severe disease or to die than patients who either were not supplemented, or were supplemented after infection. ((Anweller et. al, July 2021)
9)  A [multi-center observational](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3799) study of 1,000 hospitalized Covid patients found that Cholecalciferol supplementation was associated with lower mortality. (Ling et al, December 2020)
10) An [observational study](https://www.aging-us.com/article/202307/text) of Italian nursing home residents found that vitamin D was associated with a lower risk of dying. The authors note that "$$in$$ the absence of contraindications ... the administration of cholecalciferol in older subjects could be strongly advocated." (Cangiano et al, December 2020)
11) A [retrospective Catalonian study](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202104.0173/v1) found that patients with chronic kidney disease who were treated with calcitriol were less likely to develop severe Covid or die than matched controls. (Oristrell et al, April 2021)
12) A large [restrospective cohort study](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s40618-021-01639-9?sharing_token=Az_nLefqGViKiasX4Tu3cfe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY7ojMLtwib0-XlE4LmNRgUkAMN1i1-7qBBT83rsQhG2d9tvWZe3UXmxNNFzm8P54rcPZyk2535mgZLd-2dimfxowHBz0WPkIk0C3BEaF11cM7n8crYxSqOL66T-8rcIP_s%3D) of Spanish Covid patients found that patients who had taken calcifediol or cholecalciferol had better who achieved serum levels greater than 30 ng/ml had better Covid outcomes than propensity matched controls. (Oristrell et al, July 2021)
13) A [Turkish study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34570577/) found that hospitalized vitamin D deficient patients who were supplemented with 300,000 IU of vitamin D had a lower mortality rate than controls. (Yidiz et al, September 2021)
14) A [cohort study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-02701-5) of 16,000 Spanish Covid patients found that patients who had received vitamin D perscriptions prior to Covid hospitalization were less likely to die than those who hadn't received a perscription The effect was larger for patients perscribed calcifediol, and for those whose perscription was closer to the date of hospitalization. (Loucera et al, December 2021)

*Does not support vitamin D*

1.  A [cohort study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-021-00984-5) of 163 turkish patients found that a 300,000 IU of vitamin D administered to severely ill patients in the ICU found that while patients treated with vitamin D had a lower rate of mortality and intubation, this difference was not significant. ([Güven](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-021-00984-5#auth-Mehmet-G_ven) and [Gültekin](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-021-00984-5#auth-Hamza-G_ltekin), September 2021)

2)  An [Israeli study](https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/febs.15495) of 7,000 patients with pre-Covid serum vitamin D tests found that vitamin D levels were associated with Covid infection and hospitalization. (Eugene Merzon et al, July 2020)
3)  An [analysis](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188268v1) of Israeli vitamin D tests performed between 2010 and 2019 found that vitamin D deficiency predicted Covid-19 infection. (Israel et al, August 2020)

This association held across all age groups, ethnicities and geographies. (Kaufman et all, Sept 2020)
5)  A [study of 437 New York](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07315724.2020.1869626) Covid patients found that vitamin D levels measured up to three months prior to Covid were associated with need for supplemental oxygen, but not hospitalization or death. (Gavioli et al, February 2021)
6)  A [cohort study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2777682) of 4638 patients in Chicago found that vitamin D levels taken within the past year were associated with Covid positivity for Black patients, but not white patients. (Meltzer et al, March 2022)

10) An [Israeli study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0263069) found that vitamin D deficient people were 14x more likely to contract severe Covid than people with high levels of vitamin D. (Dror et al, February 2022)

*Does not support vitamin D link*

-   Vitamin D levels between 2006-2010 [were associated](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402120301156) with Covid-19 mortality, but not after controlling for other variables in the data set.
    It's hard to make inferences from 10 year old blood samples because there's a causal story in which low vitamin D in 2010 *increases* vitamin D in 2020 because that group is likely to supplement.
    (Hastie et al, July 2020)

28) A [Mexican study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.12.21253490v2) of 551 hospitalized patients found that low vitamin D levels were present in 45% of them, and was associated with an increased mortality risk. (Vanegas-Cedillo et al, March 2021)
29) A retrospective study of 464 patients in the UAE found that vitamin D levels below 12 ng/ml were associated with disease severity and death. (AlSafar et al, May 2021**)**

*Does not support link to vitamin D*

1)  A [small trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32960622/) did not find an association between vitamin D deficiency and Covid-19 severity. The study did find an association among younger patients. (Macaya et. al, September 2020)
2)  A [case-control study](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-96491/v1) did not find that Covid positive patients had lower vitamin D levels than patients hospitalized with non-Covid pneumonia or a set of non-respiratory conditions. The comparator groups in this study are a bit strange because low vitamin D levels are implicated in almost all of the diagnoses included in this study. See the comments associated with the paper. (Tomasti et al, October 2020)
3)  An [Italian study](https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/abs/10.1024/0300-9831/a000687) of 347 patients did not find that hospitalized Covid patients had lower serum vitamin D than non-Covid patients. The authors note that "Because a large portion of patients were below the suggested 30 ng/mL threshold, we can't exclude that VitD supplementation, restoring normal levels, might be beneficial in reducing the risk of infection." (Ferrari & Locatelli, November 2020)
4)  A [study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.07.20227512v1) of 135 hospitalized patients in the Netherlands was not assoicated with need for mechanical ventilation or death. The author's note that vitamin K may be an important factor along with vitamin D. (Walk et al, November 2020)
5)  An [Indian study](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-129238/v1?s=09) found that there was no difference in clinical outcome between vitamin D sufficient individuals ( \> 30 nmol/L) and insufficient individuals. (Jevalikar et al, December 2020)
6)  [A study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85809-y) of 400 hospitalized patients found no association between vitamin D levels and Covid outcomes. However, pre-admission supplementation habits were not measured and the vitamin D replete group were significantly older and had more comorbidities than the vitamin D deficient group. (Jevalikar et all, March 2021)

-   Calcitriol, the active form of Vitamin D [is active](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.21.162396v1) against the SARS-COV2 virus. (Chee Keng Mok et al, June 2020)
-   An in vitro [study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.02.408153v1) found that the antimicrobial peptide LL-37, which is upregulated by vitamin D, binds to the SARS-COV2 spike protein. The study "supports the prophylactic use of vitamin D to induce LL-37 that protects from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the therapeutic administration of vitamin D for the treatment of COVID-19 patients".

### Non-clinical causal data (Out of date)

*Supports vitamin D*

-   Evidence supports a [vitamin-D causal model](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.20087965v1) more than an acausal one. (Davies et al, June 13 2020)

*Does not support vitamin D*

-   A [Mendelian randomization](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.09.20171280v1.article-info) using genes associated with vitamin D deficiency did not support a causal connection between vitamin D and Covid-19 mortality. It appears that this study used UK Biobank data, but the date of the samples were not disclosed. (Liu et al, August 2020)
-   Another [Mendelian randomization](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.20190975v2.full.pdf) based on UK biobank and other genetic datasets found that people of European descent who were genetically predisposed to high vitamin D levels did not change their risk of contracting Covid, but seemed to increase their risk of hospitalization. (Butler-Laporte, September 2020)

### Ecological studies (Out of date)

-   A study out of [Northwestern University](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40520-020-01677-y) found that the vitamin D status of a country's elderly population was associated with the number of severe cases of Covid-19 in that country. (Daneshkhah1 et al, April 2020)
-   There was a [strong correlation](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.20138644v1) between vitamin D levels and European mortality which increased over time. (Chuen Wen Tan, June 2020)
