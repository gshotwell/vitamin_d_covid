# The argument for supplementation
- Vitamin D reduces the risk of [other](https://www.bmj.com/content/356/bmj.i6583) acute respiratory infections. One interesting finding of this meta-analysis is that people who were very deficient (less than 25 nmol/L) saw the largest protective effect with an adjusted odd ratio of 0.58 and a 95% CI of 0.40 to 0.82. These are the same populations which seem to be at risk for severe Covid-19
- Calcitriol, the active form of Vitamin D [is active](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.21.162396v1) against the SARS-COV2 virus
- Patients treated with calcifediol are [less likely](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960076020302764?via%3Dihub#tbl0005) to be admitted to the ICU than controls
- Several studies have now observed lower vitamin D levels among severe Covid-19 patients
- [Vitamin D is very low risk](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202005.0265/v1) an adverse events of vitamin D supplementation can be easily managed by clinicians

# Direct research on vitamin D and Covid

### Intervention studies

*Randomized*

- A [parallel pilot randomized open label](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960076020302764?via%3Dihub#tbl0005) (Castillo et all, August 2020) trial of 76 patients in Spain found that the administration of calcifediol reduced ICU admission and mortality. Of the 50 patients treated with calcifediol. 13/26 patients in the control group required ICU care compared with 1 in the intervention group.

*Cohort*

- A [small cohort trial](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.01.20112334v1) (Chuen Wen Tan, June 10 2020) found that just 16% of patients who received vitamin D, magnesium, and vitamin B12 required oxygen compared with 61.5% of the previous cohort who did  not receive DBM supplementation.

### In vitro evidence
- Calcitriol, the active form of Vitamin D [is active](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.21.162396v1) (Chee Keng Mok et al, June 2020)  against the SARS-COV2 virus.

### Covid severity associated with serum vitamin D levels

#### Post-infection blood samples

*Supports vitamin D link*

- A re-analysis of [107 Swiss blood samples](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/5/1359/htm) (Avolio et al, April 2020) found that PCR positive patients had 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations half that of PCR negatives. This finding held after stratifying for age and gender.
- Hospitalized male Covid-19 patients [were found](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.20079376v1) (De Smet et al, May 2019) to have lower vitamin D levels than controls
- A observational [study from Belgium](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.20079376v2)(De Smet, May 2020) found that vitamin D deficiency is correlated with the risk for hospitalization for COVID-19 pneumonia and predisposes to more advanced radiological disease stages.
- Vitamin D deficiency [was more common](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.21.20136903v2) (Panagiotou et all, June 2020) among ITU Covid patients than the general population in a Newcastle hospital.
- A [Mexican study](https://www.medigraphic.com/pdfs/sanmil/sm-2020/sm201_2za.pdf) (Arturo Rodríguez Tort et al, April 2020)  found that patients with vitamin D serum levels bellow 8 ng/mL had 3.68 higher risk of dying from COVID-19.
- A [Iranian study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239799) (Maghbooli et al, September 2020) found there was a significant association between vitamin D sufficiency and reduction in clinical severity. 
- A [study](https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-41173/v1/0e401c21-0b76-4f69-8cf5-0f83dfb135d3.pdf) (Carpagnano et all, August 2020) of 42 COVID-19 patients in a respiratory ICU found that 50% of vitamin D deficient patients died after 10 days compared with 5% of non-deficient patients.
- A [prospective cohort study](https://www.mdlinx.com/journal-summary/vitamin-d-status-and-outcomes-for-hospitalised-older-patients-with-covid-19/i68lJrN18PCbGXMwzC0tU) (Baktash V et all, August 2020) found that vitamin D deficiency was more common among Covid positive patients presenting with Covid symptoms than Covid negative patients, and suggested that it could be considered as a diagnostic tool. 
- [A study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170220310558) (Mardenia et all, August 2020) of patients presenting with Covid symptoms at an Iranian hospital found that vitamin D deficiency and ACE dysregulation were more common among those who tested positive for Covid-19. 
- [A German Study](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/9/2757/htm) (Radujkovic et al, August 2020) found that vitamin D status was associated with need for mechanical ventilation and death. 
- [A small prospective cohort study](https://pmj.bmj.com/content/early/2020/08/26/postgradmedj-2020-138712?s=09) (Baktash et all, September 2020) of older adults found that vitamin D deficiency was associated with mechanical ventilation, but not death.
- [A Turkish study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12603-020-1479-0) (Karahan & Katkat October 2020) found that vitamin D deficiency was associated with mortality.
- [A study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.05.20206706v1) (Aduragbemi et all, October 2020) of UK health professionals found that vitamin D deficient individuals were more likely to be seropositive for Covid antibodies.
- A study of [Covid positive children](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ppul.25106) (Yilmaz & Sen, October 2020) found that children with Covid had lower vitamin D levels than healthy controls.

*Does not support link to vitamin D*

- A [small trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32960622/) (Macaya et. all, September 2020) did not find an association between vitamin D deficiency and Covid-19 severity. The study did find an association among younger patients. 

#### Pre-infection blood samples

*Supports link to vitamin D*

- A [retrospective cohort](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.08.20095893v1.full.pdf) (Meltzer et al, May 2020) study found that Chicago patients who were likely vitamin D deficient were more likely to test positive for Covid-19.
- An [Israeli study](https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/febs.15495) (Eugene Merzon et al, July 2020) of 7,000 patients with pre-Covid serum vitamin D tests found that vitamin D levels were associated with Covid infection and hospitalization.
- An [analysis](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188268v1) (Israel et al, August 2020) of Israeli vitamin D tests performed between 2010 and 2019 found that vitamin D deficiency predicted Covid-19 infection. 
- [An analysis](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239252#pone-0239252-g002) (Kaufman et all, Sept 2020) of 190,000 patients found that the probability of testing positive was associated with vitamin D levels. This association held across all age groups, ethnicities and geographies. 

*Does not support vitamin D link*

- Vitamin D levels between 2006-2010 [were associated](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402120301156) (Hastie et al, July 2020) with Covid-19 mortality, but not after controlling for other variables in the data set. It's hard to make inferences from 10 year old blood samples because there's a causal story in which low vitamin D in 2010 _increases_ vitamin D in 2020 because that group is likely to supplement.

### Non-clinical causal data

- Evidence supports a [vitamin-D causal model](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.20087965v1) (Davies et al, June 13 2020) more than an acausal one.
- A [Mendelian randomisation analysis](https://nutrition.bmj.com/content/early/2020/05/20/bmjnph-2020-000096) (Martin Kohlmeier, May 2020) of excess COVID-19 mortality of African-Americans in the US suggests that vitamin D is a risk factor for Covid Mortality
- A [Mendelian randomization](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.09.20171280v1.article-info) (Liu et al, August 2020) using genes associated with vitamin D deficiency did not support a causal connection between vitamin D and Covid-19 mortality. It appears that this study used UK Biobank data, but the date of the samples were not disclosed.


### Ecological studies

- A study out of [Northwestern University](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20058578v3.full.pdf) (Daneshkhah1 et al, April 2020) found that the vitamin D status of a country's elderly population was associated with the number of severe cases of Covid-19 in that country.
- There was a [strong correlation](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.20138644v1) (Chuen Wen Tan, June 2020) between vitamin D levels and European mortality which increased over time.
- UVB radiation, which the skin uses to manufacture vitamin D is [associated](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3586555#.XrA5awDBBLE.twitter) (Moozhipurath et al, May 1st 2020) with lower death rates and case fatality rates.
- Covid-19 deaths-per-million appears to [vary by latitude](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32311755) (Rhodes et al, June 2020).
- Latitude [was not associated](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/cmaj/early/2020/05/08/cmaj.200920.full.pdf) (Jüni et al, June 2020) with a proportional increase in cases during one week of March.
- Latitude is a significant predictor of Covid mortality after [controlling for age](https://nutrition.bmj.com/content/3/1/118) (Rhodes et al, July 2020).
- Vitamin D levels were [inversely associated](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40520-020-01619-8) with cases per million in Europe, but not with deaths per million. (Sing, Kaur, Kumar Sigh, August 2020).
